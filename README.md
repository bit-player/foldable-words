# foldable-words

A strip of paper with the printed words "It's a pleasure to serve you" can be folded up to read "I love you". What other messages can be generated in this way. 

The question is discussed in the article [Foldable Words](http://bit-player.org/2021/foldable-words) on bit-player.org. The Jupyter notebook published here has Python code to accompany the article.
